# capstone_cascading_method_models
This project explores a novel cascading approach for threats detection, utilizing transfer learning to sequentially connect deep learning models as specialized feature extractors. Each model in the cascade refines and passes its learned representations to the next, culminating in a robust, high-precision classification.
